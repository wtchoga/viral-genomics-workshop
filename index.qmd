## Welcome to the Workshop

This intensive workshop focuses on viral genomics and pathogen evolution analysis, designed for researchers, graduate students, and public health professionals interested in understanding viral evolution through computational approaches.

### Workshop Overview

The **Viral Genomics and Evolution Workshop** brings together cutting-edge methodologies in:

- **Viral sequence analysis** and quality control
- **Phylogenetic reconstruction** and evolutionary inference  
- **Population genomics** of viral pathogens
- **Molecular epidemiology** and outbreak investigation
- **Selection pressure** and adaptation analysis
- **Drug resistance** evolution and surveillance

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to:

1. **Process and analyze** viral genomic data from raw sequencing reads
2. **Construct and interpret** phylogenetic trees for evolutionary analysis
3. **Identify signatures** of natural selection in viral genomes  
4. **Analyze population structure** and genetic diversity in viral populations
5. **Apply genomic approaches** to outbreak investigation and surveillance
6. **Use modern bioinformatics tools** for viral genomics research
